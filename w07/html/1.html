                    Several conditions are required for part of the soil on the surface to be lifted into the atmosphere by the wind and transported to a distant location. First, there must be a strong wind that can move some of these soils into the air, the soil on the surface must be very small and dry, and plant colonies must not form on the surface to prevent some of the soil from rising into the air.

                    The desert regions of China and Mongolia, the source of yellow dust, and their surrounding areas have suitable conditions for the production of yellow dust.

                    Most of the areas where yellow dust occurs are above 1,000m above sea level, making it easier for it to travel to Northeast Asia, including the Korean Peninsula, thanks to strong winds. In particular, when there is little snow or rain, yellow dust becomes more severe.
