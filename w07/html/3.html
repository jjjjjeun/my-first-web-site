                    In the case of Korea, domestic efforts have been focused on early prediction of damage, given that the causes are China and Mongolia and that Korea is only an area affected by yellow dust. In other words, as yellow dust inevitably enters the borders of the Republic of Korea riding on westerly winds , the idea is to minimize damage by predicting the path from the occurrence of yellow dust to its movement and its impact in advance.

                    However, yellow dust forecast alone cannot prevent damage. Therefore, we are currently trying to come up with a fundamental solution to the yellow dust problem by participating in the Global Environment Fund (GEF) project to respond to yellow dust in Northeast Asia. The GEF project is intended to jointly respond to the yellow dust problem among Korea, China, Japan, Mongolia, and related international organizations such as the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), through regional cooperation. We are planning to establish a system, monitor yellow dust, prepare an early warning network construction program, and select eight yellow dust prevention pilot project areas to implement a pilot project.
