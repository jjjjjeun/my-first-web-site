                    Yellow dust(Asian dust) mainly occurs in the spring when sand and dust in the deserts of China or Mongolia rise and fly away in the westerly wind , slowly disappearing. It refers to the phenomenon of sitting. It is also called tou or mud rain . On the Asian continent, China , South Korea , and Japan are the most affected by yellow dust in the spring, in that order, and the occurrence period is getting longer and pollutants are included, which is worsening every year. Yellow dust also occurs in the Sahara Desert in the northern part of the African continent.

                    Yellow dust has the advantage of preventing acidification of soil and lakes by neutralizing acid rain due to the alkaline components such as lime mixed in it, [ 1 ] and providing organic salts to plants and plankton in the sea , but it is also harmful to human health. Nation-wide measures are being required to prevent yellow dust, which is causing damage to various industries, including agriculture.
