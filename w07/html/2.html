                    Visibility is reduced in areas where yellow dust blows, and yellow dust poses a threat to the general public's health in many ways, including bronchial irritation and asthma . When yellow dust blows, it is recommended to avoid activities outside the home depending on the severity. Yellow dust can be fatal for patients with asthma or other respiratory diseases. Research results were also announced showing that the death rate increased by 1.7% in areas affected by yellow dust.
